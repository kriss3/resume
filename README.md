# Krzysztof Szczurowski - Resume

## My attempt to create an online resume using GitHub pages.
The idea here is to have an online space to put my professional journey.
It contains: 
1. Very brief intension;
2. Work experience, including work experience in UK and Canada;
3. Education history;
4. Sample of projects I was part of or major contributor;
5. Tools, libraries and frameworks I use for professional and personal projects;
